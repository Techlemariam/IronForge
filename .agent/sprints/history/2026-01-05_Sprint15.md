# Sprint 15: The Oracle Protocol
**Period**: 2025-12-29 - 2026-01-05
**Goal**: Launch Bio-Game Intelligence with Oracle Engine v1.

## Backlog

### Priority: High (The Oracle Seed)
- [ ] **Feature: Oracle Reasoning Engine** <!-- agent: performance-coach | estimate: 5h | source: strategy -->
  - *Ingest Intervals (Wellness) + Hevy (Volume). Output daily "Oracle Decree" (Buff/Debuff).*
- [ ] **Feature: Bio-Soul Binding Mechanics** <!-- agent: game-designer | estimate: 4h | source: strategy -->
  - *High HRV → "Clarity Buff" (+XP). High Fatigue → "Iron Burden" (Combat Difficulty +).*
- [ ] **Feature: Rest Day Enforcement** <!-- agent: titan-coach | estimate: 3h | source: strategy -->
  - *If Oracle says "Rest": Replace "Push Day" with "Active Recovery / Mobility".*

### Priority: Medium (UX Polish & Intelligence)
- [ ] **Feature: Oracle Temple UI** <!-- agent: ui-ux | estimate: 4h | source: strategy -->
  - *New Citadel Room: View bio-metrics mapped to game stats.*
- [ ] **Feature: Program Comparison View** <!-- agent: ui-ux | estimate: 2h | source: ux-audit -->
  - *Side-by-side diff for AI-generated training plans.*

### Priority: Low (Tech Health)
- [ ] **Tech: Tests for program.ts & gameplay.ts** <!-- agent: qa | estimate: 2h | source: health-report -->
  - *AI plan generation and loot logic coverage.*
- [ ] **Polish: Focus Rings & Modal Focus Trap** <!-- agent: ui-ux | estimate: 1h | source: ux-audit -->
  - *Accessibility pass for keyboard navigation.*

## Self-Evaluation (Pre-Approval)

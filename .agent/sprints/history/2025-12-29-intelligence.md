# Next Sprint: Intelligence & Periodization
**Period**: 2025-12-29 → 2026-01-05  
**Goal**: Enable intelligent training adaptation and complete Iron Command Center

## Backlog

### Priority: High
- [ ] **Iron Leagues** (Competitive seasonal rankings) <!-- agent: game-designer | estimate: 4h | source: roadmap | roi: 5.5 -->
- [ ] **Enhanced Volume Calculator L1** (Naive scaling coefficient) <!-- agent: coder | estimate: 2h | source: roadmap | roi: 4.5 -->
- [ ] **Enhanced Volume Calculator L2** (Dual-coefficient: stimulus + recovery) <!-- agent: coder | estimate: 3h | source: roadmap | roi: 4.5 -->

### Priority: Medium
- [ ] **Powerlifting Tournament Brackets** (Bracket-style competitions) <!-- agent: game-designer | estimate: 3h | source: roadmap | roi: 3.7 -->
- [ ] **Training DNA Export** (Exportable methods for marketplace) <!-- agent: coder | estimate: 3h | source: roadmap | roi: 3.5 -->
- [ ] **Guild Creation** (Create and manage guilds) <!-- agent: coder | estimate: 3h | source: roadmap | roi: 2.5 -->

### Priority: Low
- [ ] **Enhanced Volume Calculator L3** (Per-muscle adaptation) <!-- agent: coder | estimate: 3h | source: roadmap | roi: 4.5 -->

## Sprint Stats
- **Total Items**: 7
- **Estimated Hours**: 21h
- **Debt Ratio**: 0%
- **Focus**: Intelligence + Competitive features

## Dependencies
- Volume Calculator levels build on each other (L1→L2→L3)
- Iron Leagues requires existing PvP infrastructure (shipped)

## Rationale
**Selection Criteria:**
1. Highest remaining ROI items (Iron Leagues: 5.5)
2. Volume Calculator foundation (enables Auto-Periodization)
3. Mix of competitive and analytical features

**Strategic Value:**
- Iron Leagues: Major retention and engagement driver
- Volume Calculator: Foundation for AI training
- Tournament Brackets: Powerlifter engagement

# IronForge Agent System Documentation

Welcome to the **IronForge Autonomous Agent Ecosystem**. This directory contains the "brain" of your project—a set of specialized agents, protocols, and workflows designed to minimize manual labor.

## 📂 Directory Structure

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `workflows/` | **The Doers**. Executable instructions for specific tasks (e.g., `/coder`, `/feature`). |
| `rules/` | **The Laws**. Global constraints and protocols (e.g., errors, bootstrap). |
| `features/` | **The Map**. Central roadmap and backlog (`roadmap.md`). |
| `sprints/` | **The Engine**. Nightly autonomous execution logs (`current.md`). |
| `memory/` | **The Cortex**. Preferences, knowledge graphs, and long-term context. |
| `handoffs/` | **The Baton**. Structured data for inter-agent communication. |
| `feedback/` | **The Mirror**. Error logs and self-improvement data. |

## 🚀 Key Workflows

### 1. Feature Development
**Command**: `/feature [name]`
**Description**: Fully orchestrated pipeline from Roadmap → Idea → Code → Test → Deploy.
**Source of Truth**: `.agent/features/roadmap.md`

### 2. Autonomous Sprints
**Command**: `/sprint-auto`
**Description**: Non-interactive execution of the backlog defined in `.agent/sprints/current.md`. Best run overnight.

### 3. System Maintenance
**Command**: `/health-check`, `/cleanup`, `/evolve`
**Description**: Audits code quality, removes debt, and optimizes the agent system itself.

## 🧠 Cognitive Architecture (Level 4+)
This system is not just a collection of scripts. It possesses:
- **Memory**: Remembers your preferences in `memory/preferences.json`.
- **Foresight**: Suggests actions via `rules/predictive-suggester.md`.
- **Knowledge**: Maps dependencies in `memory/knowledge-graph.json`.

## 🛠Configuration
- **Slash Commands**: Registered in `.agent/config.json`.
- **IDE Integration**: Linked via `.antigravity/config.json`.

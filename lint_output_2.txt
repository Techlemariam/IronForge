78:21  Warning: Using `<img>` could result in slower LCP and higher bandwidth. Consider using `<Image />` from `next/image` or a custom image loader to automatically optimize images. This may incur additional usage or cost from your provider. See: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-img-element  @next/next/no-img-element

./src/features/training/CardioStudio.tsx
502:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'activeDuel' and 'sessionDuration'. Either include them or remove the dependency array.

./src/hooks/useOfflineMode.ts
60:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'pendingActions.length' and 'syncPendingActions'. Either include them or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

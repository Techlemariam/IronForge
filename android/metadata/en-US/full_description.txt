IronForge turns your strength training into a fantasy RPG. Every set you log deals damage to bosses, earns you gold, and levels up your character.

🔥 **Gamified Training**
Sync your workouts from Hevy or log them directly. Your volume (weight × reps) becomes your combat power.

⚔️ **Boss Battles**
Face off against elemental titans. Use your squats to crush the Earth Titan and your bench press to push back the Iron Golem.

🛡️ **Craft & Upgrade**
Use loot drops to craft better gear. Equip items that boost your stats based on your real-world lifting performance.

📊 **Advanced Metrics**
Visualize your training volume, track PRs, and monitor your muscle groups with our 3D visualizer.

🔌 **Seamless Integrations**
- **Hevy**: Import history automatically.
- **Strava**: Cardio sessions count towards your stamina.
- **Intervals.icu**: Wellness data impacts your daily energy.

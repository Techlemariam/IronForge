Compares the database schema from two arbitrary sources, and outputs the differences either as a human-readable summary (by default) or an executable script.

prisma migrate diff is a read-only command that does not write to your datasource(s).
prisma db execute can be used to execute its --script output.

The command takes a source --from-... and a destination --to-....
The source and destination must use the same provider,
e.g. a diff using 2 different providers like PostgreSQL and SQLite is not supported.

It compares the source with the destination to generate a diff.
The diff can be interpreted as generating a migration that brings the source schema (from) to the shape of the destination schema (to).
The default output is a human readable diff, it can be rendered as SQL using `--script` on SQL databases.

Usage

  $ prisma migrate diff [options]

Options

  -h, --help               Display this help message
  --config                 Custom path to your Prisma config file
  -o, --output             Writes to a file instead of stdout

From and To inputs (1 `--from-...` and 1 `--to-...` must be provided):
  --from-empty             Flag to assume from or to is an empty datamodel
  --to-empty

  --from-schema            Path to a Prisma schema file, uses the datamodel for the diff
  --to-schema

  --from-migrations        Path to the Prisma Migrate migrations directory
  --to-migrations

  --from-config-datasource Flag to use the datasource from the Prisma config file
  --to-config-datasource

Flags

  --script                 Render a SQL script to stdout instead of the default human readable summary (not supported on MongoDB)
  --exit-code              Change the exit code behavior to signal if the diff is empty or not (Empty: 0, Error: 1, Not empty: 2). Default behavior is Success: 0, Error: 1.

Examples

  From the configured database to a Prisma datamodel
    e.g. roll forward after a migration failed in the middle
  $ prisma migrate diff \
    --from-config-datasource \
    --to-schema=next_datamodel.prisma \
    --script

  From a peisma datamodel to the configured database
    e.g. roll forward after a migration failed in the middle
  $ prisma migrate diff \
    --from-schema=next_datamodel.prisma \
    --to-config-datasource \
    --script

  From a Prisma Migrate `migrations` directory to the configured database
    e.g. generate a migration for a hotfix already applied on production
  $ prisma migrate diff \
    --from-migrations ./migrations \
    --to-config-datasource \
    --script

  Execute the --script output with `prisma db execute` using bash pipe `|`
  $ prisma migrate diff \
    --from-[...] \
    --to-[...] \
    --script | prisma db execute --stdin --url="$DATABASE_URL"

  Detect if both sources are in sync, it will exit with exit code 2 if changes are detected
  $ prisma migrate diff \
    --exit-code \
    --from-[...] \
    --to-[...]

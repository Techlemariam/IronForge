# 🔥 IronForge Codex: System Bible (v2.0)

> **Clearance:** Level 5 (Omni) | **Protocol:** IRON-AUTH-100 | **State:** ABSOLUTE

## 📜 The Prime Directive (Manifesto)

**"We do not build apps. We build heavy machinery for the human spirit."**

IronForge is a **Cyber-Physical Operating System**. It is the interface between biological potential and realized kinetic output. We reject the "fitness industry" of soft platitudes and participation trophies. We embrace the **Iron Truth**:

* Gravity doesn't negotiate.
* The rep either went up, or it didn't.
* You are either evolving, or you are decaying.

## 👁️ Visual Protocol: "The Dark Foundry"

The interface is a military-grade HUD found in a mech cockpit. It works in the dark. It glows with dangerous energy.

### 1. The Chromatic Lattice (Periodic Table)

| Element | Hex | Tailwind | Role | Physics | ARPG Rarity (Loot) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Void** | `#030712` | `bg-gray-950` | Vacuum/Canvas | Infinite Depth | *Map Boundary* |
| **Armor** | `#111827` | `bg-gray-900` | Structural/Card | Hardened Steel | *Trash Mob* |
| **Plasma** | `#f97316` | `text-orange-500` | **Primary Action** | Heat/Energy | **Legendary** |
| **Pulse** | `#0ea5e9` | `text-sky-500` | **Intelligence** | Electric Flow | **Rare (Magic)** |
| **Venom** | `#22c55e` | `text-green-500` | **Restoration** | Chemical Buff | **Set Item** |
| **Crisis** | `#ef4444` | `text-red-500` | **Critical** | Alarm/Failure | **Cursed** |
| **Gold** | `#eab308` | `text-yellow-500` | **Legendary** | Rare Metal | **Artifact** |

### 2. Kinetic Physics (Animation)

The UI does not "slide". It **Deploys**.

* **Deployment:** `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` (The "Bolt Action" Curve). Fast entry (150ms), mechanical lock.
* **Recoil:** Active elements scale to `0.98` on press.
* **Decay:** Toasts/Notifications do not fade. They "Switch Off" (`scale-95 opacity-0` instant).

---

## 🔊 Sonic Architecture (Audio Protocol)

Sound is half the interface. It confirms physical reality.

* **Success:** *High-frequency Metallic Clink* (Sword sheathing).
* **Failure:** *Low-frequency Thud* (Heavy door closing).
* **Notification:** *Digital Chirp* (Radar contact).
* **Timer:** *Sub-bass Heartbeat* (60bpm rising to 120bpm).

> **Rule:** No "melodies". Only textures. Sounds should feel like they come from the device's hardware, not a speaker.

---

## ⚡ Haptic Telemetry (Physical Feedback)

The device must feel like a tool in the hand.

* **Light Impact (Selection):** Sharp, short tick (10ms).
* **Heavy Impact (Action):** Deep, resonant thud (50ms).
* **Warning (Error):** Double rapid pulse (Buzz-Buzz).
* **Victory (PR):** Ascending ripple pattern.

## 📊 HUD Data Standards (Visualization)

Data is ammunition. Display it with military precision.

1. **The "Glance" Rule:** A user mid-set with sweat in their eyes must read the metric in **0.5 seconds**.
    * *Typography:* Monospace Numbers (`JetBrains Mono`). High Contrast.
2. **No Smoothing:** Show the raw volatility of the data. If the heart rate spikes, the graph spikes.
3. **Thresholds:** Data changes color dynamically based on zones.
    * *Zone 1-2:* Pulse Blue.
    * *Zone 3-4:* Plasma Orange.
    * *Zone 5:* Crisis Red.

## 🎮 The ARPG Layer (Game Theory)

We translate physical effort into digital dopamine using Blizzard-grade mechanics.

### 1. The "Loot Drop" Psychology

We do not just "show stats". We **drop loot**.

* **Common (Grey/Steel):** Standard sets. The grind.
* **Rare (Blue/Pulse):** Good form, high volume. reliable performance.
* **Legendary (Orange/Plasma):** Breaking a plateau. A "Boss Kill" lift.
* **Artifact (Gold):** All-time Personal Record (PR). The UI explodes.

### 2. "Ding!" (The Sonic Reward)

* **Level Up / PR:** Triumphant, heavy metallic resonance. NOT a chirpy app notification. It must trigger the same Pavlovian response as a WoW Level Up.

### 3. Spec Your Character (The Trinity)

Users don't just "exercise". They build a class.

* **Warden:** Tank Spec (Str/Def).
* **Pathfinder:** Rogue/Hunter Spec (Agi/Sta).
* **Juggernaut:** Fury Warrior Spec (Hybrid).

## 🗣️ The 4 Laws of Communication (Voice)

1. **Law of Precision:** Never say in 10 words what can be said in 3.
    * *Bad:* "You have successfully finished your session."
    * *Good:* "**Session Complete.**"

2. **Law of Immersion:** Use in-universe terminology.
    * *Workout* → **Operation**
    * *Gym* → **Sector**
    * *Rest* → **Regeneration**

3. **Law of Authority:** We are the Commander, not the Buddy.
    * *Bad:* "Oops, something went wrong!"
    * *Good:* "**System Error. Retrying...**"

4. **Law of Elevation:** Frame action as meaning.
    * *Log Weight* → **Commit Data**
    * *Start Timer* → **Initiate Countdown**

---

## 💾 Developer Protocol (Codebase Culture)

The code *is* the machine.

1. **Zero-Trust Types:** `any` is a structural weakness. It is forbidden.
2. **The 100ms Budget:** Any interaction >100ms is lag. Lag breaks immersion. Use `useOptimistic`.
3. **Component Rigidity:** UI components must not "jump" (CLS 0). Reserve skeletons for all async data.
4. **Error Handling:** Fail gracefully. Provide "Tactical Retreat" (Retry) or "Evac" (Home).

## ⚔️ The Trinity (Archetypes)

| Archetype | Icon | Philosophy | UI Theme |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Warden** | 🛡️ | **Immovable Object.** Strength. | Gold / Serif / Heavy Borders |
| **Pathfinder** | ⚡ | **Unstoppable Force.** Speed. | Cyan / Italic / Thin Lines |
| **Juggernaut** | 🩸 | **Controlled Chaos.** Hybrid. | Crimson / Aggressive Contrast |

## 💯 The "Iron 100" Check

A feature is strictly **FORBIDDEN** unless it passes the IRON 100:

1. **I**mmersive: Does it sound/feel/look like a machine?
2. **R**eliable: Is it instant (<100ms)?
3. **O**ptimized: Is it accessible in high-stress environments (gym)?
4. **N**arrative: Does it make the user feel like a Titan?

> **System Status (v2.0):** The Bible is Written. Compliance is Absolute.
